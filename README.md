# Joix
## Disclaimer  
This is provided as-is
I started this project to have some fun with presseed and scripting so this implies there's no consideration about anything else than what's provided: no security, checks, validation or anything else implied.  
## WARNING:
The iso is configured with simplicity in mind and is a "press enter" installation - No jokes.  
This means it will nuke the first hard drive the installer find to install Joix.
So: be carfull on the hardware you use  
## What's in the box?
This is intended to be executed by joix.iso installer.
